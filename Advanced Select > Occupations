Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. 
The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.

Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.

SELECT
  COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Doctor' THEN Name END), NULL) AS Doctor,
  COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Professor' THEN Name END), NULL) AS Professor,
  COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Singer' THEN Name END), NULL) AS Singer,
  COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Actor' THEN Name END), NULL) AS Actor
FROM (
  SELECT Name, Occupation,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Occupation ORDER BY Name) AS rownum
  FROM Occupations
) AS sub
GROUP BY rownum;
