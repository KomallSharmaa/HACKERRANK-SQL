Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. 
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. 
Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. 
If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. 
If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, 
then exclude those students from the result.




WITH ChallengeCounts AS (
    SELECT h.hacker_id, 
           h.name, 
           COUNT(c.challenge_id) AS c_count
    FROM Hackers h
    JOIN Challenges c ON c.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
    GROUP BY h.hacker_id, h.name
)
SELECT hacker_id, name, c_count
FROM ChallengeCounts
WHERE c_count = (
    SELECT MAX(c_count)
    FROM ChallengeCounts
)
OR c_count IN (
    SELECT c_count
    FROM ChallengeCounts
    GROUP BY c_count
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)
ORDER BY c_count DESC, hacker_id;
