SELECT
  ROUND(
    AVG(CASE
      WHEN row_num = total_rows / 2 + 0.5 THEN LAT_N
      WHEN row_num = total_rows / 2 + 1 THEN LAT_N
    END),
    4
  ) AS Median
FROM (
  SELECT
    LAT_N,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N) AS row_num,
    COUNT(*) OVER () AS total_rows
  FROM STATION
) AS subquery;
